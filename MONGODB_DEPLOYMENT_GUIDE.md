- **Mongoose ODM** - Object modeling and schema validation
- **Auto-detection** - Automatically uses MongoDB if `MONGODB_URI` is configured

### 📊 Schema Migration
- **User Management** - Player accounts and cash balances
- **Company System** - Full company management with industry specialization
- **Employee Management** - NPC and player workforce tracking
- **Patent System** - Intellectual property and revenue tracking
- **Loan System** - Credit scoring and loan management
- **Industry Specialization** - Complete specialization system support

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Industry Specialization Support** - Full integration with revenue multipliers, efficiency bonuses, and valuation premiums
- **Credit Score Enhancement** - Specialization level now affects credit scores (+15 points per level)
- **Automatic Fallback** - Maintains SQLite compatibility for development
- **Performance Optimized** - Proper indexing and efficient queries

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Your `.env` file is already configured with:
```env
# MongoDB Atlas (production)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://xwest4487_db_user:UIervlcYnYDRWRYU@cluster0.b5epeji.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
DB_NAME=corporate_empire

# SQLite (development fallback)
