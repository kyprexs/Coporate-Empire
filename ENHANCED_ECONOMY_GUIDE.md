## ‚öôÔ∏è Economic Mechanics

### Worker Productivity

- **NPC Workers**: 1.0x productivity multiplier
  - Cheaper to hire and maintain
  - Predictable but limited output
  - Generated revenue = Salary √ó 1.0

- **Player Workers**: 2.5x productivity multiplier
  - Higher maintenance cost (salaries go to real players)
  - Significantly higher revenue generation
  - Generated revenue = Salary √ó 2.5

### Monthly Economic Cycle (Every 24 Real Hours)

Each day at midnight, the system automatically processes:

1. **Revenue Generation**
   - Employee productivity: `salary √ó productivity_multiplier` for each worker
   - Patent royalties: Monthly revenue for approved patents

2. **Expenses**
   - Payroll: Salaries paid to NPC workers (deducted from company) and player workers (added to player accounts)
   - Loan payments: Principal + interest for all active loans
   - Taxes: 8% of total revenue sent to Central Bank

3. **Company Updates**
   - Net income calculation: Revenue - Taxes - Payroll - Loan Payments
   - Valuation adjustment: Based on monthly performance
   - Financial records updated

4. **Government Processing**
   - Central Bank balance updated with tax revenue and loan interest
   - Economic cycle statistics recorded
   - Monthly reports sent to company owners

### Credit Scoring & Loans

Companies receive credit scores (300-850) based on:
- **Company Age**: Longer operational history = higher score
- **Valuation Growth**: Current vs. starting valuation
- **Profitability**: Average monthly profit history

Interest rates vary by credit score:
- 750+: 5% annually
- 700-749: 8% annually  
- 650-699: 12% annually
- 600-649: 15% annually
- 500-599: 18% annually
- Below 500: 25% annually

### Patent Revenue

Approved patents generate passive monthly income:
- Default: $5,000/month (admin configurable)
- Duration: 20 years from approval
- Revenue scales with patent importance (admin discretion)

## üéØ Game Strategy Tips

### For Company Owners

1. **Early Game**: Start with NPC workers to establish cash flow
2. **Growth Phase**: Hire player workers for 2.5x productivity boost
3. **Innovation**: Submit patents for passive income streams
4. **Expansion**: Use loans strategically for rapid growth
5. **Optimization**: Balance payroll costs vs. productivity gains

### Economic Balance

- **NPC vs Player Workers**: Players cost more but generate 150% more value
- **Loan Strategy**: Good credit scores enable cheap expansion capital
- **Patent Portfolio**: Diversify income sources beyond employee productivity
- **Tax Planning**: 8% tax on all revenue - factor into pricing strategies

## üîß Admin Management

### Daily Operations

- Monitor economic cycle processing via `/admin scheduler_status`
- Review patent applications with `/patent pending`
- Check Central Bank health with `/loan bank_status`
- View economy-wide statistics with `/admin economy_status`

### Testing & Debugging

- Manually trigger economic cycles with `/admin trigger_cycle`
- Reinitialize default companies if needed
- Monitor server logs for processing errors

### Balancing

Adjust these values in environment variables:
- `TAX_RATE` - Government revenue percentage
- `DEFAULT_PATENT_REVENUE` - Base patent monthly income
- `CENTRAL_BANK_STARTING_BALANCE` - Government starting funds
- Productivity multipliers (in database methods)

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`
3. Set `BOT_ADMIN_ID` to your Discord user ID
4. Start the bot: `npm start`
5. The system will automatically:
   - Create database tables
   - Initialize default companies
   - Start the economic scheduler
   - Begin processing monthly cycles every 24 hours

## üìä Monitoring

The bot logs all economic activities:
- Company revenue processing
- Tax collection
- Loan payments and defaults
- Patent revenue distribution
- System errors and warnings

Monitor the console output and consider setting up log aggregation for production deployments.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential expansions:
- Insurance claim system
- Stock market price fluctuations
- Contract negotiations between companies
- Economic events and market crashes
- Mergers and acquisitions
