    'healthcare': 1.2,      // Medical and pharmaceutical
    'energy': 1.15,         // Oil, gas, renewable energy
    'manufacturing': 1.1,   // Production and assembly
    'retail': 1.0,          // Consumer goods sales

2. **Marketing System** - Additional complexity layer

## 🎮 Revenue Balancing Recommendations

### Current Issues:
- Player employees might be too powerful (2.5x multiplier)
- Patents provide steady income without much risk
- No scaling challenges for large companies

### Suggested Adjustments:
```javascript
// More balanced employee system
const productivityMultipliers = {
    'npc_entry': 1.0,
    'npc_experienced': 1.3,
    'player_entry': 2.0,
    'player_experienced': 3.0,
    'player_executive': 4.0
};

// Patent revenue decay over time
const patentAging = Math.max(0.5, 1 - (monthsSinceApproval * 0.02));

// Company size efficiency caps
const maxEmployees = 50; // Diminishing returns beyond this
const efficiencyPenalty = totalEmployees > maxEmployees ? 0.9 : 1.0;
```

### Enhanced Revenue Formula:
```
Total Revenue = (Employee Revenue × Industry Multiplier × Efficiency Rating × Market Conditions) + Patent Revenue + Asset Income + Market Share Bonus - Operating Costs
```

## 📊 Revenue Scaling Examples with Enhancements:

**Tech Startup (Enhanced):**
- Industry: Technology (1.3x multiplier)
- 2 NPCs @ $3,000 = $7,800 revenue
- 1 Player @ $6,000 = $19,500 revenue  
- Efficiency: 1.0, Market conditions: 1.0
- **Monthly Net: ~$25,000** (much higher than basic system)

**Manufacturing Giant (Enhanced):**
- Industry: Manufacturing (1.1x multiplier)
- 20 NPCs @ $5,000 = $110,000 revenue
- 15 Players @ $8,000 = $330,000 revenue
- Efficiency: 0.95 (size penalty), Market: 1.0
- 8 Patents = $40,000
- **Monthly Net: ~$380,000** (realistic for large manufacturing)

Would you like me to implement any of these additional features? I'd recommend starting with **Industry Specialization** as it's easy to add but provides significant gameplay depth and revenue variation.
