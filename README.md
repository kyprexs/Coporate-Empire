## 📝 How It Works

### 1. Application Submission Process
1. Player uses `/company create` in Discord
2. Bot creates a private ticket channel
3. Player fills out application modal
4. **Application automatically uploaded to GitHub** (pending folder)
5. Admin reviews and approves/denies
6. **File moved to appropriate folder** (approved/denied)

### 2. Automatic File Naming
Applications are saved with this format:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD]_[CompanyName]_[ApplicantUsername].md
```
Example: `2024-03-15_TechNova-Industries_johnsmith.md`

### 3. Application Status Tracking
